# CollagenMineralStress
These two codes calculate the tensile and shear stress for the collagen and mineral phase from the trajectory files of the simulations under the current path.
Please modify the "Sims" vairable to the name of your simulation directories in these codes.
The LAMMPS trajectory file must be in a folder called "dump" under the simulation directory.
